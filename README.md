### ⏳ CHRONOTRIS - Multi-Timeline Tetris
**File:** `chronotris.html`

Manage **three parallel timelines simultaneously** on one screen. Past, Present, and Future timelines interact through temporal causality.

**Unique Mechanics:**
- **Temporal Cascade**: Clearing lines in Past affects Present
- **Future Echo**: See 5 seconds ahead as ghost preview
- **Time Splice**: Merge all three timelines for 10 seconds (high risk/reward)
- **Paradox Penalty**: Impossible states trigger random garbage blocks

**Why It's Innovative:** No Tetris variant has ever done true multi-timeline management with causal relationships between boards.

### 🧠 EMPATHRIS - Emotion-Responsive Tetris
**File:** `empathris.html`

Pieces **change behavior based on your emotional state**. Your feelings directly affect gameplay physics.

**Emotional States:**
- **Calm**: Normal gameplay
- **Frustrated**: Pieces fall faster, rotate erratically
- **Happy**: Pieces split into smaller blocks (easier to fit)
- **Surprised**: Time briefly slows
- **Focused**: Pieces glow with optimal placement hints

**Emotional Combo**: Stay in one emotion for 60+ seconds to unlock special abilities like "Zen Mode" (clears bottom row).

**Why It's Innovative:** First Tetris to use biofeedback concepts as core gameplay. Emotional regulation becomes a skill.

---

### 📖 NARRATRIS - Story-Driven Tetris
**File:** `narratris.html`

Each tetromino **represents a character**. Clearing lines creates moral dilemmas—do you sacrifice beloved characters for points?

**Character System:**
- I-piece = Neo (Hero)
- O-piece = Agent (Villain)
- T-piece = Morpheus (Mentor)
- S/Z-pieces = Trinity & Cypher (Allies/Rivals)
- J/L-pieces = Oracle & Tank (Support)

**Narrative Features:**
- **Dialogue Triggers**: When pieces touch, story moments occur
- **Tragic Clears**: Clearing lines kills characters—choose score vs. preservation
- **Multiple Endings**: 12 different story conclusions based on survivors
- **Branching Paths**: Character interactions unlock different narrative routes

**Why It's Innovative:** First Tetris with emergent narrative and emotional attachment to pieces.

### 🌍 ECOTRIS - Ecosystem Simulation Tetris
**File:** `ecotris.html`

Pieces are **organisms in a food chain**. Create balanced ecosystems or watch them collapse from starvation and overpopulation.

**Species Hierarchy:**
- I = Apex Predator, O = Herbivore, T = Plant
- S/Z = Decomposers, J/L = Mid-tier Predators

**Ecological Mechanics:**
- **Energy Flow**: Predators need adjacent prey to survive
- **Overpopulation**: Too many of one species causes die-offs
- **Symbiosis Bonus**: Harmonious combinations give bonus points
- **Extinction Event**: Species disappearing triggers meteor showers
- **Balance Meter**: Ecosystem health tracked in real-time

**Why It's Innovative:** Inverts Tetris from destruction to creation. Forces ecological thinking and diversity management.

### 👁️ OBLIVITRIS - Memory-Based Invisible Tetris
**File:** `oblivitris.html`

Placed pieces **gradually fade from visibility**. Play entirely from spatial memory.

**Memory Mechanics:**
- **Fade Timeline**: Visible for 3s → 50% opacity at 6s → invisible at 10s
- **Sonar Pulse**: Limited reveals (3 per game) to briefly see all blocks
- **Ghost Memory**: Last 5 placements show as faint outlines
- **Memory Strain**: Fade speed increases as you survive longer
- **Archaeologist Mode**: Bonus points for clearing lines without using sonar

**Why It's Innovative:** Transforms Tetris from visual-spatial to memory-spatial. Scientifically trains working memory.

---

### ⚛️ QUANTRIS - Quantum Superposition Tetris
**File:** `quantris.html`

Pieces exist in **superposition of ALL 7 shapes** until you "observe" them by dropping.

**Quantum Mechanics:**
- **Superposition**: Each falling piece is blurry overlay of all tetrominos
- **Wavefunction Collapse**: Only collapses to one shape when dropped
- **Probability Manipulation**: Rotating shifts probability distribution
- **Entanglement**: Every 5th piece is entangled with the next (complementary shapes)
- **Schrödinger's Line**: Lines exist in superposition until next piece
- **Measurement Streak**: Predict correct shapes for multiplier bonuses

**Why It's Innovative:** First puzzle game implementing true quantum superposition mechanics. Play probabilistically, not deterministically.

---

### 🎵 SYMPHTETRIS - Musical Composition Tetris
**File:** `symphtetris.html`

Every placement is a **musical note**. Compose songs while playing Tetris using Web Audio API.

**Musical System:**
- **7 Instruments**: Each piece = different instrument (Bass, Drums, Piano, Violin, Guitar, Brass, Synth)
- **Vertical Pitch**: Higher placement = higher musical note
- **Horizontal Timing**: Left-to-right = timing within musical measure
- **Chord Clearing**: Harmonically compatible pieces sound pleasant and give bonuses
- **Dissonance Penalty**: Bad combinations create harsh sounds and reduce points
- **Genre Modes**: Jazz (rewards improvisation), Classical (rewards patterns), Electronic (rewards repetition)

**Why It's Innovative:** Unlike rhythm games that follow pre-made songs, this is **generative music creation through Tetris**.

---

### 🏗️ ARCHITRIS - Structural Engineering Tetris
**File:** `architris.html`

- **Collapse Physics**: Unstable structures collapse realistically
- **Wind Events**: Random gusts require lateral bracing
- **Earthquake Mode**: Shaking tests structural integrity
- **Blueprint Challenges**: "Build tower 15 blocks high" or "Create bridge with 20 pieces"

**Why It's Innovative:** Combines Tetris with **real structural engineering constraints**. Educational for STEM concepts.

---

### ⚛️ PHILOSOPHTRIS - Multi-Ruleset Philosophical Tetris
**File:** `philosophtris.html`

Each level follows **a different philosophical system's logic**. Perfect companion to the Wittgenstein collection!

**Philosophical Systems:**

**Platonism**: Only perfect rectangles (no gaps) can clear lines
**Nihilism**: Clearing lines means nothing—they don't disappear
**Utilitarianism**: Maximize happiness, minimize suffering (pieces have values)
**Existentialism**: You define your own win condition (radical freedom)
**Stoicism**: Garbage rains constantly—maintain composure despite external chaos
**Buddhism**: Pieces reincarnate as different shapes; reach enlightenment (empty board)
**Absurdism**: Lines reappear after clearing (Sisyphean mode—"one must imagine Tetris player happy")

**Why It's Innovative:** First game using different ethical/metaphysical systems as actual rulesets. Educational philosophy through embodied interaction.

## 🎮🧠 Language Games Tetris
**File:** `language-tetris.html`

The perfect fusion: Tetris mechanics meet Wittgenstein's philosophy! Play Tetris while experiencing how the same pieces take on different meanings in different "language games."

**The Concept:**
- Same Tetris pieces, but their conceptual meaning changes with each level
- Four progressive "language games" (contexts/forms of life)
- Each game relabels the pieces to demonstrate how meaning emerges from use

**Language Games Progression:**

1. **🏗️ Builder's Language Game** (Level 1)
   - Pieces as building materials: Beam, Block, Joint, Slab, Pillar
   - "In the builder's practice, these words are commands for action"

2. **📜 Poet's Language Game** (Level 2)
   - Pieces as emotions: Longing, Wholeness, Balance, Flow, Reaching
   - "Poetry uses words metaphorically—same shapes, different meanings"

3. **🏪 Market Language Game** (Level 3)
   - Pieces as marketplace items: Baguette, Apple, Scale, Ribbon, Hook
   - "In commerce, the same forms take on transactional meanings"

4. **🔬 Scientist's Language Game** (Level 4)
   - Pieces as technical terms: Linear, Unit, Junction, Helix, Vector
   - "Scientific language strives for precision, but it's still use in practice"

**Gameplay Features:**
- Progressive difficulty with faster drop speeds
- Bonus philosophical points for understanding contexts
- Track which "word families" you're currently playing with
- Philosophical achievement rankings at game over
- Same Tetris mechanics you know, but with deeper meaning!

**What You Learn:**
- The same Tetris I-block can be a "Beam" (builder), "Longing" (poet), "Baguette" (market), or "Linear" (science)
- Context determines meaning—the piece doesn't change, but its role in different "language games" does
- Words gain meaning through use in specific practices
- Forms of life shape how we interpret and use language

**Difficulty:** Familiar Tetris gameplay with philosophical depth

---

## 🧠 Wittgenstein's Language Games Collection

A series of educational games exploring Ludwig Wittgenstein's revolutionary philosophy of language from *Philosophical Investigations* (1953). Each game demonstrates a different aspect of how meaning emerges from use, context, and social practices.

### Core Philosophical Concepts:
- **Meaning is Use**: Words gain meaning through how they're used in practice, not through abstract definitions
- **Language Games**: Different contexts (forms of life) have different rules and conventions
- **Forms of Life**: Language is embedded in social practices and shared activities
- **Family Resemblance**: Concepts form networks of overlapping similarities, not strict hierarchies

---

### 🎯 Context Shift
**File:** `context-shift.html`

Discover how the same phrase means completely different things depending on context.

**Gameplay:**
- Receive ambiguous phrases like "Can you pass?" or "That's a strike!"
- Determine which context (language game) you're in
- Choose the correct action from multiple possibilities
- Soccer game, card game, exam, hallway—same words, different meanings!

**What You Learn:**
- Context disambiguates meaning
- Words don't have fixed, eternal meanings
- Understanding requires knowing which "game" is being played

**Difficulty:** Beginner-friendly introduction to language games

---

### 🏗️ The Builder's Apprentice
**File:** `builders-apprentice.html`

Experience Wittgenstein's famous thought experiment: learning language through practice, not definition.

**Gameplay:**
- Start as an apprentice with just 4 words: Block, Pillar, Slab, Beam
- Learn meaning by responding to the builder's gestures and needs
- As construction progresses, vocabulary naturally expands
- New words emerge when new practices require them

**What You Learn:**
- Language acquisition through doing, not memorizing definitions
- Meaning emerges from successful participation in shared activities
- Even primitive language games (4 words!) show how meaning works
- Vocabulary grows organically with practice

**Difficulty:** Progressive learning from simple to complex

---

### 🧩 Family Resemblance
**File:** `family-resemblance.html`

Explore how concepts form networks of overlapping similarities rather than strict definitions.

**Gameplay:**
- Examine different uses of words like "game," "language," and "work"
- Identify which uses share properties (competition, rules, fun, etc.)
- Discover that no single feature is common to ALL uses
- See how meanings overlap like family members' features

**What You Learn:**
- Words don't have "essential" definitions
- Concepts are held together by family resemblances
- Some games have competition, some have rules, some have neither—yet all are games!
- Meaning forms networks, not hierarchies

**Difficulty:** Intermediate pattern recognition

---

### 🌍 Lost in Translation
**File:** `lost-in-translation.html`

Navigate conversations across different "forms of life" where the same words create misunderstandings.

**Gameplay:**
- Witness conversations between people from different contexts
- Scientists vs. Poets, Lawyers vs. Friends, Artists vs. Scientists
- Identify where miscommunication occurs
- Choose responses that bridge different language games

**What You Learn:**
- Different forms of life (scientific, artistic, religious) use words differently
- A scientist's "beauty" differs from a poet's "beauty"
- Misunderstandings arise from assuming everyone plays the same language game
- Understanding requires recognizing and translating between different practices

**Difficulty:** Advanced cross-contextual thinking

## 📚 Further Reading

These games are based on Ludwig Wittgenstein's *Philosophical Investigations* (1953), particularly sections:
- §1-64: Builder example and primitive language games
- §65-88: Family resemblance and the concept of "game"
- §19-25: Language games and forms of life
- §243-315: Private language argument and meaning as use

**Key Quote:**
> "For a large class of cases of the employment of the word 'meaning'—though not for all—this word can be explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its use in the language."
> — Wittgenstein, *Philosophical Investigations* §43
