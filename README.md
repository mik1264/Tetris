## 🎮🧠 Language Games Tetris
**File:** `language-tetris.html`

The perfect fusion: Tetris mechanics meet Wittgenstein's philosophy! Play Tetris while experiencing how the same pieces take on different meanings in different "language games."

**The Concept:**
- Same Tetris pieces, but their conceptual meaning changes with each level
- Four progressive "language games" (contexts/forms of life)
- Each game relabels the pieces to demonstrate how meaning emerges from use

**Language Games Progression:**

1. **🏗️ Builder's Language Game** (Level 1)
   - Pieces as building materials: Beam, Block, Joint, Slab, Pillar
   - "In the builder's practice, these words are commands for action"

2. **📜 Poet's Language Game** (Level 2)
   - Pieces as emotions: Longing, Wholeness, Balance, Flow, Reaching
   - "Poetry uses words metaphorically—same shapes, different meanings"

3. **🏪 Market Language Game** (Level 3)
   - Pieces as marketplace items: Baguette, Apple, Scale, Ribbon, Hook
   - "In commerce, the same forms take on transactional meanings"

4. **🔬 Scientist's Language Game** (Level 4)
   - Pieces as technical terms: Linear, Unit, Junction, Helix, Vector
   - "Scientific language strives for precision, but it's still use in practice"

**Gameplay Features:**
- Progressive difficulty with faster drop speeds
- Bonus philosophical points for understanding contexts
- Track which "word families" you're currently playing with
- Philosophical achievement rankings at game over
- Same Tetris mechanics you know, but with deeper meaning!

**What You Learn:**
- The same Tetris I-block can be a "Beam" (builder), "Longing" (poet), "Baguette" (market), or "Linear" (science)
- Context determines meaning—the piece doesn't change, but its role in different "language games" does
- Words gain meaning through use in specific practices
- Forms of life shape how we interpret and use language

**Difficulty:** Familiar Tetris gameplay with philosophical depth

## 🧠 Wittgenstein's Language Games Collection

A series of educational games exploring Ludwig Wittgenstein's revolutionary philosophy of language from *Philosophical Investigations* (1953). Each game demonstrates a different aspect of how meaning emerges from use, context, and social practices.

### Core Philosophical Concepts:
- **Meaning is Use**: Words gain meaning through how they're used in practice, not through abstract definitions
- **Language Games**: Different contexts (forms of life) have different rules and conventions
- **Forms of Life**: Language is embedded in social practices and shared activities
- **Family Resemblance**: Concepts form networks of overlapping similarities, not strict hierarchies

---

### 🎯 Context Shift
**File:** `context-shift.html`

Discover how the same phrase means completely different things depending on context.

**Gameplay:**
- Receive ambiguous phrases like "Can you pass?" or "That's a strike!"
- Determine which context (language game) you're in
- Choose the correct action from multiple possibilities
- Soccer game, card game, exam, hallway—same words, different meanings!

**What You Learn:**
- Context disambiguates meaning
- Words don't have fixed, eternal meanings
- Understanding requires knowing which "game" is being played

**Difficulty:** Beginner-friendly introduction to language games

---

### 🏗️ The Builder's Apprentice
**File:** `builders-apprentice.html`

Experience Wittgenstein's famous thought experiment: learning language through practice, not definition.

**Gameplay:**
- Start as an apprentice with just 4 words: Block, Pillar, Slab, Beam
- Learn meaning by responding to the builder's gestures and needs
- As construction progresses, vocabulary naturally expands
- New words emerge when new practices require them

**What You Learn:**
- Language acquisition through doing, not memorizing definitions
- Meaning emerges from successful participation in shared activities
- Even primitive language games (4 words!) show how meaning works
- Vocabulary grows organically with practice

**Difficulty:** Progressive learning from simple to complex

---

### 🧩 Family Resemblance
**File:** `family-resemblance.html`

Explore how concepts form networks of overlapping similarities rather than strict definitions.

**Gameplay:**
- Examine different uses of words like "game," "language," and "work"
- Identify which uses share properties (competition, rules, fun, etc.)
- Discover that no single feature is common to ALL uses
- See how meanings overlap like family members' features

**What You Learn:**
- Words don't have "essential" definitions
- Concepts are held together by family resemblances
- Some games have competition, some have rules, some have neither—yet all are games!
- Meaning forms networks, not hierarchies

**Difficulty:** Intermediate pattern recognition

---

### 🌍 Lost in Translation
**File:** `lost-in-translation.html`

Navigate conversations across different "forms of life" where the same words create misunderstandings.

**Gameplay:**
- Witness conversations between people from different contexts
- Scientists vs. Poets, Lawyers vs. Friends, Artists vs. Scientists
- Identify where miscommunication occurs
- Choose responses that bridge different language games

**What You Learn:**
- Different forms of life (scientific, artistic, religious) use words differently
- A scientist's "beauty" differs from a poet's "beauty"
- Misunderstandings arise from assuming everyone plays the same language game
- Understanding requires recognizing and translating between different practices

**Difficulty:** Advanced cross-contextual thinking
