## 🎮🧠 Language Games Tetris
**File:** `language-tetris.html`

The perfect fusion: Tetris mechanics meet Wittgenstein's philosophy! Play Tetris while experiencing how the same pieces take on different meanings in different "language games."

**The Concept:**
- Same Tetris pieces, but their conceptual meaning changes with each level
- Four progressive "language games" (contexts/forms of life)
- Each game relabels the pieces to demonstrate how meaning emerges from use

**Language Games Progression:**

1. **🏗️ Builder's Language Game** (Level 1)
   - Pieces as building materials: Beam, Block, Joint, Slab, Pillar
   - "In the builder's practice, these words are commands for action"

2. **📜 Poet's Language Game** (Level 2)
   - Pieces as emotions: Longing, Wholeness, Balance, Flow, Reaching
   - "Poetry uses words metaphorically—same shapes, different meanings"

3. **🏪 Market Language Game** (Level 3)
   - Pieces as marketplace items: Baguette, Apple, Scale, Ribbon, Hook
   - "In commerce, the same forms take on transactional meanings"

4. **🔬 Scientist's Language Game** (Level 4)
   - Pieces as technical terms: Linear, Unit, Junction, Helix, Vector
   - "Scientific language strives for precision, but it's still use in practice"

**Gameplay Features:**
- Progressive difficulty with faster drop speeds
- Bonus philosophical points for understanding contexts
- Track which "word families" you're currently playing with
- Philosophical achievement rankings at game over
- Same Tetris mechanics you know, but with deeper meaning!

**What You Learn:**
- The same Tetris I-block can be a "Beam" (builder), "Longing" (poet), "Baguette" (market), or "Linear" (science)
- Context determines meaning—the piece doesn't change, but its role in different "language games" does
- Words gain meaning through use in specific practices
- Forms of life shape how we interpret and use language

**Difficulty:** Familiar Tetris gameplay with philosophical depth

## 🧠 Wittgenstein's Language Games Collection

A series of educational games exploring Ludwig Wittgenstein's revolutionary philosophy of language from *Philosophical Investigations* (1953). Each game demonstrates a different aspect of how meaning emerges from use, context, and social practices.

### Core Philosophical Concepts:
- **Meaning is Use**: Words gain meaning through how they're used in practice, not through abstract definitions
- **Language Games**: Different contexts (forms of life) have different rules and conventions
- **Forms of Life**: Language is embedded in social practices and shared activities
- **Family Resemblance**: Concepts form networks of overlapping similarities, not strict hierarchies

---

### 🎯 Context Shift
**File:** `context-shift.html`

Discover how the same phrase means completely different things depending on context.

**Gameplay:**
- Receive ambiguous phrases like "Can you pass?" or "That's a strike!"
- Determine which context (language game) you're in
- Choose the correct action from multiple possibilities
- Soccer game, card game, exam, hallway—same words, different meanings!

**What You Learn:**
- Context disambiguates meaning
- Words don't have fixed, eternal meanings
- Understanding requires knowing which "game" is being played

**Difficulty:** Beginner-friendly introduction to language games

---

### 🏗️ The Builder's Apprentice
**File:** `builders-apprentice.html`

Experience Wittgenstein's famous thought experiment: learning language through practice, not definition.

**Gameplay:**
- Start as an apprentice with just 4 words: Block, Pillar, Slab, Beam
- Learn meaning by responding to the builder's gestures and needs
- As construction progresses, vocabulary naturally expands
- New words emerge when new practices require them

**What You Learn:**
- Language acquisition through doing, not memorizing definitions
- Meaning emerges from successful participation in shared activities
- Even primitive language games (4 words!) show how meaning works
- Vocabulary grows organically with practice

**Difficulty:** Progressive learning from simple to complex

---

### 🧩 Family Resemblance
**File:** `family-resemblance.html`

Explore how concepts form networks of overlapping similarities rather than strict definitions.

**Gameplay:**
- Examine different uses of words like "game," "language," and "work"
- Identify which uses share properties (competition, rules, fun, etc.)
- Discover that no single feature is common to ALL uses
- See how meanings overlap like family members' features

**What You Learn:**
- Words don't have "essential" definitions
- Concepts are held together by family resemblances
- Some games have competition, some have rules, some have neither—yet all are games!
- Meaning forms networks, not hierarchies

**Difficulty:** Intermediate pattern recognition

---

### 🌍 Lost in Translation
**File:** `lost-in-translation.html`

Navigate conversations across different "forms of life" where the same words create misunderstandings.

**Gameplay:**
- Witness conversations between people from different contexts
- Scientists vs. Poets, Lawyers vs. Friends, Artists vs. Scientists
- Identify where miscommunication occurs
- Choose responses that bridge different language games

**What You Learn:**
- Different forms of life (scientific, artistic, religious) use words differently
- A scientist's "beauty" differs from a poet's "beauty"
- Misunderstandings arise from assuming everyone plays the same language game
- Understanding requires recognizing and translating between different practices

**Difficulty:** Advanced cross-contextual thinking

### ⏰ CHRONOTRIS - Multi-Timeline Tetris
**File:** `chronotris.html`

Navigate THREE parallel timelines simultaneously on one screen!

**Unique Mechanics:**
- Three vertical boards (Past, Present, Future) displayed side-by-side
- Pieces fall in all three timelines at once - control them independently
- **Temporal Cascade**: Clearing a line in PAST causes blocks in PRESENT to shift down
- **Future Echo**: See ghostly 5-second previews in the FUTURE timeline
- **Time Splice**: Merge all three timelines for 10 seconds (3 uses per game)
- **Paradox Penalty**: Random garbage appears if you create impossible temporal states

**Innovation:** Existing time-rewind games let you undo mistakes. This forces **simultaneous temporal strategy**—think about cause and effect across three timelines at once!

---

### 😊 EMPATHRIS - Emotion-Responsive Tetris
**File:** `empathris.html`

Pieces change behavior based on your detected emotion!

**Emotion States:**
- **😌 Calm**: Normal speed, standard Tetris
- **😠 Angry/Frustrated**: Pieces fall faster and rotate erratically
- **😄 Happy/Smiling**: Pieces occasionally split into smaller blocks (easier placement)
- **😲 Surprised/Shocked**: Time briefly slows for recovery
- **🎯 Focused/Concentrated**: Pieces show optimal placement suggestions
- **Emotional Combo**: Stay in one emotion for 60+ seconds to unlock special abilities (Zen Mode!)

**Innovation:** Biofeedback gaming applied to Tetris! Turn emotional regulation into a core gameplay skill. Creates a meditative, self-awareness loop. (Demo mode: click emotion buttons to simulate biofeedback)

---

### 📖 NARRATRIS - Story-Driven Tetris
**File:** `narratris.html`

Each tetromino is a CHARACTER. Clearing lines advances a branching narrative!

**The Cast:**
- 🦸 Hero (I-Piece), 😈 Villain (O-Piece), 🧙 Mentor (T-Piece)
- ⚔️🗡️ Rivals (S/Z-Pieces), 👤👥 Allies (J/L-Pieces)

**Story Mechanics:**
- **Dialogue Triggers**: When pieces touch, story events unfold
- **Plot Lines**: Different piece combinations unlock story branches
- **Tragic Clears**: Clearing a line destroys those characters—do you score points or preserve beloved characters?
- **12 Different Endings**: Based on which characters survived and which combinations you created

**Innovation:** Tetris has never had **emergent narrative**. Creates emotional attachment to pieces and moral dilemmas!

---

### 🌿 ECOTRIS - Ecosystem Simulation Tetris
**File:** `ecotris.html`

Build a balanced food chain ecosystem, not just clear lines!

**Species Hierarchy:**
- 🦅 Apex Predator (I), 🐺🦊 Mid-tier Predators (J/L), 🐰 Herbivores (O)
- 🌱 Plants (T), 🍄🪲 Decomposers (S/Z)

**Ecosystem Mechanics:**
- **Energy Flow**: Predators need to be adjacent to prey to "feed" or they die
- **Overpopulation**: Too many of one species causes starvation—random pieces vanish!
- **Symbiosis Bonus**: Decomposers + Plants give bonus points and regenerate lines
- **Extinction Event**: If any species disappears completely, meteor shower (garbage blocks) strikes!
- **Balance Meter**: Keep all species alive for maximum ecosystem health

**Innovation:** Tetris is typically about **destruction** (clearing lines). This inverts it into **creation and balance**. Forces ecological thinking!

---

### 👁️‍🗨️ OBLIVITRIS - Memory-Based Invisible Tetris
**File:** `oblivitris.html`

Placed pieces gradually fade from visibility. Play entirely from spatial memory!

**Memory Mechanics:**
- **Fade Timeline**: Pieces fully visible for 3s → 50% opacity → completely invisible after 10s
- **Sonar Pulse**: Press S to briefly (1 second) reveal all hidden blocks—limited to 3 pulses per game
- **Memory Strain**: The longer you survive, the faster pieces fade
- **Ghost Memory**: Last 5 placed pieces show as faint outlines
- **Penalty**: Trying to place in forgotten occupied space loses a life
- **Archaeologist Mode**: Bonus points for clearing lines without using sonar pulses (perfect memory!)

**Innovation:** Turns Tetris from **visual-spatial** to **memory-spatial**. Trains working memory in neuroscience-backed ways!

---

### ⚛️ QUANTRIS - Quantum Superposition Tetris
**File:** `quantris.html`

Pieces exist in MULTIPLE STATES simultaneously until you "observe" them!

**Quantum Mechanics:**
- **Superposition**: Each falling piece is a blurry overlay of ALL 7 tetromino types at once
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Only when you press DROP does the piece collapse into ONE specific shape (randomly determined)
- **Probability Manipulation**: Rotating changes probability distribution (more rotations = higher chance of I-piece)
- **Entanglement**: Every 5th piece is "entangled" with the next—they collapse into complementary shapes
- **Measurement Streak**: Successfully predicting collapse shapes builds a score multiplier

**Innovation:** Applies actual **quantum mechanics concepts** to gameplay—not as a theme, but as real mechanics. You're playing probabilistically, not deterministically!

---

### 🎵 SYMPHTETRIS - Musical Composition Tetris
**File:** `symphtetris.html`

Every placement is a musical note. Compose a song while playing Tetris!

**The Orchestra:**
- 7 Instruments: I=Bass 🎸, O=Drums 🥁, T=Piano 🎹, S=Violin 🎻, Z=Trumpet 🎺, J=Sax 🎷, L=Synth 🎧

**Music Mechanics:**
- **Vertical Pitch**: Higher placement = higher pitch; lower = lower pitch
- **Horizontal Timing**: Left side = early in measure; right side = later
- **Chord Clearing**: Harmonically compatible pieces (I+T, T+S) sound pleasant and give bonus points
- **Dissonance Penalty**: Bad combinations create harsh sounds and reduce points
- **Genre Modes**: Classical (rewards patterns), Jazz (rewards improvisation), Electronic (rewards repetition)

**Innovation:** Music rhythm games exist, but they follow pre-made songs. This is **generative music creation through Tetris**!

---

### 🏗️ ARCHITRIS - Structural Engineering Tetris
**File:** `architris.html`

Build structurally sound towers that must withstand physics simulation!

**Material Types:**
- 🏛️ Steel Beams (I-Piece) = Strong vertical support
- ⬜ Foundation (O-Piece) = Most stable base
- ⚙️ Load-bearing (T-Piece) = Medium strength
- 🔗 Weak Joints (S/Z-Pieces) = Fragile, will collapse under stress!
- 📐 Cantilevers (J/L-Pieces) = Support pieces

**Engineering Mechanics:**
- **Stress Visualization**: Pieces turn 🟢 green (safe) → 🟡 yellow (moderate) → 🔴 red (critical)
- **Collapse Physics**: Overstressed pieces fail and trigger cascading collapse
- **Earthquake Mode**: Test your structure's resilience to lateral forces
- **Engineering Score**: Rated on stability, height, and material efficiency

**Innovation:** Unlike pure physics Tetris (Not Tetris 2), this has **engineering constraints**—you must understand load distribution, center of gravity, bracing!

---

### 🧠 PHILOSOPHTRIS - Multi-Ruleset Philosophical Tetris
**File:** `philosophtris.html`

Each level follows a different PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM's logic—Tetris rules change based on schools of thought!

**The Philosophies:**

**📖 Platonism (Idealism)**
- Only perfectly filled rectangles (no gaps) clear lines
- Imperfect placements remain forever
- Teaches: The ideal vs. the real

**⚫ Nihilism**
- Clearing lines means nothing—they don't disappear, score doesn't increase
- Only goal: keep playing as long as possible
- Teaches: Meaning-making in meaninglessness

**⚖️ Utilitarianism**
- Each piece has a "happiness value"—maximize total happiness
- Clearing lines gives happiness, destroying certain pieces causes suffering
- Teaches: Consequentialist ethics and the greatest good

**🎭 Existentialism**
- You choose your own win condition at the start
- No predefined rules—you define what "success" means
- Teaches: Radical freedom and responsibility

**🗿 Stoicism**
- Garbage blocks rain constantly (outside your control)
- Scored on how calmly you respond (endurance)
- Teaches: Control what you can, accept what you can't

**🕉️ Buddhism**
- Clearing lines makes pieces "reincarnate" as different shapes
- Goal is to reach "enlightenment" (empty board)
- Teaches: Impermanence and non-attachment

**🔄 Absurdism (Camus)**
- Sisyphean mode: Every time you clear lines, they reappear
- Scored on whether you keep playing despite futility
- "One must imagine Tetris player happy"
- Teaches: Revolt against meaninglessness

**Innovation:** **Perfect thematic fit for this repository's Wittgenstein collection!** Each philosophical system creates genuinely different gameplay—you're learning philosophy through embodied interaction. No game has used different ethical/metaphysical systems as rulesets!
